quality-hell=Do you like Quality?  I sure do.  This mod adds a new mechanic where most crafting machines start with a small base level of product quality chance.  As you craft more items with that machine, the chance goes up.  The rate this happens at can be adjusted in the settings.\n\nThe goal of this mod is to give a fun challenge when trying to build a factory that can't *not* flood the belts with junk.  Discover new ways to route items around without causing backups.\n\nFor the "tricks" part of tips and tricks: You can change out the recipe of a machine without resetting the built up quality.  How will you re-arrange your factory to take advantage of high-throughput machines without picking any of them up?
quality-acceleration=[tooltip=Quality Acceleration Modules,tips-and-tricks-item-description.quality-acceleration-module-list] increase the *rate* at which a machine increases its quality chance.  Each item crafted with a quality acceleration module will count as one additional craft.  For each level of quality acceleration module, the bonus goes up by one.  \n\nExamples:\n A machine with 2 basic Quality acceleration modules will count as having crafted 3 items every time it completes a craft.\nA crafting machine 3 with 4 Quality acceleration modules would count as completing 13 crafts. (1 + 3x4)
